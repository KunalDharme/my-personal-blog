        <h2>The Hounds of Baskerville</h2>
        <p class="date">March 12, 2011</p>
        <p>
          Sherlock and I were approached by Henry Knight, a man haunted by the memory of his father being attacked by a gigantic hound on Dartmoor. While Sherlock was skeptical, he took the case—mostly out of boredom.
        </p>
        <p>
          We traveled to Baskerville, a military base near the moor, and uncovered rumors of genetic experiments and psychological warfare. Sherlock was visibly rattled for the first time I’d ever seen—something truly shook him.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we dug deeper, it became clear that what Henry saw was not a real beast, but the result of a powerful hallucinogenic gas and a conspiracy involving the base itself. Sherlock set up a trap and tricked his own mind into believing the hound was real to understand the victim's terror.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, the truth was more disturbing than any supernatural story: fear weaponized.
