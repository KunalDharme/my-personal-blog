        <h2>A Study in Pink</h2>
        <p class="date">January 14, 2010</p>
        <p>
          This was my first real case with Sherlock Holmes. The police were baffled by a series of suicides, all committed in similar fashion. But Sherlock instantly suspected something more sinister.
        </p>
        <p>
          We visited the latest scene – a woman's body in a derelict house, dressed immaculately. Sherlock deduced that she had scratched a name onto the floor before she died. "Rache" — a clue or a message?
        </p>
        <p>
          The case twisted and turned rapidly, with Sherlock always two steps ahead. He eventually faced the killer – a cabbie who played a deadly game, forcing victims to choose between two pills, one harmless, one fatal.
        </p>
        <p>
          He offered Sherlock the same choice. I stepped in at the last moment... with a gun I hadn’t used since Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          That day, I became more than a flatmate. I became a part of something incredible.
